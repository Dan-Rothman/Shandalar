Popup for graveyard,exile, and stack zones (zone similar to hand zone)
	Graveyard/Exile, only be able to see the top card of each zone. But when you click on it, popup of entire zone.
	Like MTG Arena
	Stack will pop up when relevant
	Popup should have title of zone somewhere to add clarity
	
	
Cards are fuzzy, figure out how to make them readable
	Its because they're too small. If I scale them up by 5x, they look nice. 
	How do we scale everything up? Who knows
	

Conditional movement of cards
	If card is a land, and its in your hand and you click on it, play it.
	If card is a land on the battlefield, tap it
	
	
Program a 'phases' button
Make it so when you go to draw phase, draw a card.
Upload changes so I don't mess with things
