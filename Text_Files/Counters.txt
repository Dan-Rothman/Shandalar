
Counters are generally placed on cards on the battlefield, however there are cases where cards can have counters in other zones. This will NOT be comprehensive, there are
many many MANY niche counters that will not be discussed here(ex. feather counters, divinity counters). In general, these counters behave like +1/+1 counters, which will be discussed.


+1/+1 counters (Also applies to other stat-changing counters like -1/-1 counters)

	-When these counters are on a creature, the power and toughness of that creature is adjusted based on those counters.
			ex, if a 2/2 has 3 +1/+1 counters on it, consider it a 5/5.
	-Counters placed on a permanent are removed from that permanent when it moves zones.
	
Suspend counters

	-Placed on a card in exile.
	-Remove a suspend counter at the beginning of your upkeep. Then, if there are no suspend counters on it, you may cast it without paying its mana cost.
